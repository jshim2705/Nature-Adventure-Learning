                <h2>Importance of our Cause</h2>
                <p>Every student learns differently. However, it’s important to acknowledge these differences and provide comfort and support for students to make them feel included and supported. For decades students, particularly those with learning disabilities, have faced difficulties overcoming fears of judgment and question their aptitude when it comes to their learning goals and aspirations in life. Like others, they too seek fulfillment in what they do. Rather than criticizing a student for their differences, it’s important to embrace them wholeheartedly and ensure they receive the resources fitted for their learning style.</p>
                <p>However, in spite of each student having varying abilities, nature can provide suitable learning environment for students of all learning backgrounds while simultaneously improving their mental and psychological wellbeing.</p>
                <h2>Why learn in nature?</h2>
                    Learning in nature can help students:
                    relieve stress
                    create focus
                    boost confidence and happiness
                    develop genuine enthusiasm and interest for learning
                Aside from ensuring a student’s well-being, learning in nature is an approach designed to help students of  varying learning abilities including those with disabilities.
                Some common examples include the following:
                    For students with ADHD, learning in nature can improve their attention span and lessen anxiety while learning while providing a calming, relaxing environment for their mind.
                    For students with dyslexia, learning outside may involve a variety of hands-on work and activities that can enables students to learn by doing.
                    For students with autism, work outside may include interacting and learning with other students or nature which can help them build and develop social skills while still being able to learn effectively.
                <p>As a whole, learning in nature is intended to provide an enriching, proactive, and supportive environment for students to feel a sense of achievement and belonging allowing them to thrive in and out of their learning.
