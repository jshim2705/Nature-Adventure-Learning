# Nature Adventure Learning

## Project Category
Educational Social Impact

## Key elements (what we built)
An informative website + Unity Game linked to the website for users to play

## Inspiration
As students with varying learning abilities, we understand the importance of having an effective, supportive learning environment. We've witnessed the lack of care for students, specifically those with learning disabilities or various other styles of learning. In environments where every student learns at a different pace/speed, it's important to acknowledge those differences and embrace them wholeheartedly. Nature Adventure Learning is designed to help reach all students regardless of learning style and ability. By connecting and learning with nature, students can feel a positive influence on their mental and physical well-being while being supported by their educators. By playing our interactive Unity Game linked on our website, students can then decide if they'd like to sign up for our program by learning in nature.
